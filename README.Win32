The underlying IO::Socket::INET does not support non-blocking sockets on
Win32, thus non-blocking IO::Socket::SSL is not supported on Win32, which
means also, that timeouts don't work (because they are based on
non-blocking).

Because fork() on Win32 is just an incomplete implementation using threads
the tests might block, e.g. the test suite will not succeed.
