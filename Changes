v0.95
	- Changed PeerAddr in example/ssl_client.pl back to localhost.
	- Update of examples to automatically switch to the proper
	  directory if they cannot find the necessary SSL certificates.
	- Minor documentation update with more INET6 info.
	- Corrected some error messages for IO::Socket::INET6.
	- Better opened() behavior when sockets close unexpectedly.
	- Added note about random number generators for Solaris users
	  (Problem found by Christian Gilmore <cag at us.ibm.com>).
	- Added support for WeakRef and Scalar::Util to allow
	  IO::Socket::SSL objects to auto-destroy themselves when 
	  they go out of scope.
	- Added croak()ing for unimplemented send() and recv() methods
	  so they are not accidentally used to transmit unencrypted
	  data.  The Perl builtin functions cannot be reliably trapped
	  and are still dangerous, a fact that the POD now reflects
	  (Problem noted by Michal Ludvig <michal at logix.cx>).

--- Old Versions --------------------------------------------------

v0.94  2003.6.26
	- Changed accept() to use inherited accept() instead of
	  IO::Socket::accept, so that IPv6 inheritance is possible.
	- Added options to import() so that a user could specify
	  IPv6 or IPv4 mode of operation.
	- Documentation fixes, esp. e-mail address.

v0.93  2003.6.24
	- Fixed error-checking slip in connect_SSL() (Problem found by
	  Uri Guttman <uri at stemsystems.com>).
	- All functions now return the empty list () on errors.
	- Added note about the above change to appease Graham Barr
	  <gbarr at pobox.com>.
	- Fixed Net::SSLeay giving warnings when arguments are undef;
	  in all cases, undef arguments may be set to '' without any
	  change in behavior except for removing the warnings.
	  (Problem found by Dominique Quatravaux <dom at idealx.com>)
	- If accept() or connect() fails in SSL negotiation, the user
	  now has the option to print something to the failed socket
	  before it is closed.  (error_trap option in new())
	- Added support for CRLs (SSL_check_crl option in new()) for
	  versions of OpenSSL >= 0.9.7b (Original patch from
	  Brian Lindauer <jbl at sysd.com>)
	- Finally added decent support for certificate callbacks.
	  (SSL_verify_callback option in new(), suggestion from
	  Dariush Pietrzak <eyck at ghost.anime.pl>).
	- accept()/connect()/socket_to_SSL() now fail immediately if
	  the socket in question does not have a fileno.
	- Added the kill_socket() method to guarantee that a socket dies.
	- Fixed extra warning when printing errors in debug mode.
	- Deprecated socket_to_SSL() in favor of the class method
	  start_SSL() (Class method suggestion from Graham Barr
	  <gbarr at pobox.com>).
	- Added the class method start_SSL() to allow for cases when
	  the desired class of the socket is not IO::Socket::SSL
	  (Request from Dariush Pietrzak <eyck at ghost.anime.pl>)
	- Changed socket_to_SSL to rebless socket to original class
	  if SSL negotiation failed (Request from Graham Barr
	  <gbarr at pobox.com>)
	- Removed the daemon.pl example, as it did not work with the
	  standard distribution of HTTP::Daemon (use HTTP::Daemon::SSL
	  instead).

v0.92   2002.10.22
	- Changed the fileno() function to support returning the fileno
	  of server sockets.  (Problem found by Roland Giersig
	  <RGiersig at cpan.org>).
	- Fixed SSL_version incorrectly defaulting to SSLv2 (patch from
	  Roland Alder <roland.alder at celeris.ch>).

v0.91   2002.08.31
	- Added support for SSL_peek and SSL_pending (peek() and
	  pending()).  Updated documentation, tests, etc. to reflect
	  this.

v0.901  2002.08.19
	- Fixed the warning that happens when sockets are not explicitly
	  closed() before the program terminates.


v0.90   2002.08.13
	- This version is a complete rewrite of IO::Socket::SSL.  It now
	  has about half the lines of code, twice the amount of documentation,
	  and a slightly more polished interface.
	- IO::Socket::SSL now works properly with mod_perl and taint mode.
	- Major documentation update.
	- Update of the BUGS file to reflect changes made in the rewrite.
	- Update of the test suite for Perl v5.8.0 (or, more precisely,
	  for Scalar::Util).
	- Update of the test suite for Perl v5.00503 (or, more precisely,
	  for the lack of several nice features added in v5.6.0) (Marko
	  Asplund <aspa at kronodoc.fi>).
	- New test suite that does not need the Internet to function.
	- Update of all the files in example/ to use more current features
	  of IO::Socket::SSL.
	- Removal of SSL_SSL and X509_Certificate classes.
	- There have been a few name changes (like socketToSSL ->
	  socket_to_SSL) for better consistency.
	- The functionality of get_peer_certificate() and friends is deprecated.
	- The functionality of want_write() and want_read() is deprecated.
	- The functionality of context_init() is deprecated for normal use.
	- Support for all SSL context options in the new() call.
	- SSL contexts are no longer global.  The SSL_reuse_ctx option
	  is provided for those who want to re-use a context.
	- The default verify mode is now VERIFY_NONE.
	- IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG is now linked to Net::SSLeay::trace to
	  provide different levels of debugging information.
	- There is a uniform interface for error reporting, so on error
	  all functions will return undef and the error will be available
	  by calling errstr().
	- The dump_peer_certificate() and peer_certificate() functions
	  have been added.
	- sysread() will now behave correctly if the offset argument is
	  greater than the length of the read buffer.  It also will truncate
	  the read buffer properly, according to the Perl documentation for
	  sysread().
	- getline(), getlines(), and getc() have been added.
	- syswrite() now uses references to avoid copying large	amounts of data.
	- readline() uses ssl_read_all in array context for improved speed.
	- close() now uses SSL_shutdown() to properly close an SSL connection,
	  unless you tell it not to.
	- If you have Net::SSLeay version 1.18 or greater, X509 certificates
	  will be properly freed.
	- All other known bugs have been fixed.

	- Added support for SSL_passwd_cb.
	- Added accept() server socket support to socketToSSL().

v0.81   2002.04.10

	- docs/debugging.txt file added
	- require Net::SSLeay v1.08
	- preliminary support for non-blocking read/write

	  all SSL_version parameter values have to be changed. valid values
	  include: 'sslv2', 'sslv3', 'sslv23'. Stephen C. Koehler
	  <koehler at securecomputing.com>.
	- enable selecting SSL version for connections. patch from
	  Takanori Ugai <ugai at jp.fujitsu.com>.
	- allow setting SSL_ca_file to ''. this is needed for being
	  able to use SSL_ca_path (Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe at orcus.priv.at>).
	- include the Apache CA bundle file in the distribution (my-ca.pem).
	- BUGS file added.

v0.77	2001.01.15

	  actually used for the connections.
	- default SSL protocol version selection in SSL.pm.
