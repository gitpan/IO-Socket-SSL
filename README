IO::Socket::SSL is a class implementing an object oriented
interface to SSL sockets. The class is a descendent of
IO::Socket::INET and provides a subset of the base class's
interface methods.

in order to use IO::Socket::SSL you need to have Net_SSLeay
v1.03 or newer installed.

in addition to providing a general OO interface to SSL sockets
this package can be used with libwww-perl. at present, this
requires a few changes to LWP modules:

	1. LWP/Protocol/htts.pm: in _new_socket a IO::Socket::SSL
	   object has to be created instead of IO::Socket::INET.
	   replace 'require Net::SSL' with 'require
	   IO::Socket::SSL' (diffs/LWP_Protocol_https.pm.diff).

	2. HTTP/Daemon.pm: replace '@ISA=qw(IO::Socket::INET);'
	   with '@ISA=qw(IO::Socket::SSL);' and add a use statement:
	   'use IO::Socket::SSL;' (diffs/HTTP_Daemon.pm.diff).
